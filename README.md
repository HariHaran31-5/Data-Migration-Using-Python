# Data-Migration-Using-Python
This repository contains a comprehensive solution for executing a data migration process using Python. Data migration is the process of transferring data between storage types, formats, or computer systems. Our implementation ensures a smooth and efficient migration by leveraging Python's robust libraries and tools.

1) Source and Destination Flexibility: Supports various data sources and destinations. Source - SSMS, Target - MySQL.
2) Data Transformation: Includes data transformation capabilities to clean, normalize, and adapt data to fit the target schema.
3) Error Handling and Logging: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging to ensure transparency and ease of troubleshooting.
4) Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently, with options to scale out to multiple machines or use cloud-based services.
5) Data Validation: Includes pre- and post-migration validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.
